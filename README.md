Urban Grid Analysis - Clustering Analysis of street Network Patterns

The research paper titled ‘Urban spatial order: street network orientation, configuration and entropy’ was studied in depth and methods used in the study were understood. Table 1 ‘Resulting indicators for the 100 study sites’ was extracted and converted into csv format. Min-max scaling of all the features in the dataset was performed and the following features ‘'ς', 'k̅', 'P4w’ were rescaled to ensure that they lie within the 0-1 range, as outlined in the research article K means clustering was then performed on the rescaled dataset and the number of clusters were determined using the Elbow method. The Principal Component analysis was performed to visualize the clustering results. The results were visualized using a scatter plot and 3 distinct clusters were determined. Cluster distribution, profiles and centroid were also determined. Hierarchical clustering was then performed on the same dataset. Different linkage methods such as ‘Single’ ‘complete’ ‘average’ , ‘Ward’ and ‘Centroid’ were used. Ward was chosen as the appropriate linkage method to perform clustering as it was the same method used in the research paper. A cluster cut off distance of 2 was then used and 5 clusters were obtained.

The clustering results were visualized using dendrograms.
